# CustomerSegmentation

This project aims to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a given dataset. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, which can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial step for businesses to understand their customers better. By grouping customers into segments based on similarities, companies can personalize their marketing efforts, enhance customer experience, and ultimately drive sales. In this notebook, we utilize K-Means clustering to identify customer segments from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer-related information, including features such as:

- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Other relevant attributes

Please ensure that the dataset is available in the correct format to run the analysis.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this notebook:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
  
You can install these libraries using the following command:
