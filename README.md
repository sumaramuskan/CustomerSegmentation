# Customer Segmentation 

This project aims to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a given dataset. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, which can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial step for businesses to understand their customers better. By grouping customers into segments based on similarities, companies can personalize their marketing efforts, enhance customer experience, and ultimately drive sales. In this notebook, we utilize K-Means clustering to identify customer segments from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer-related information, including features such as:

- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Other relevant attributes

Please ensure that the dataset is available in the correct format to run the analysis.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this notebook:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
  
You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumaramuskan/CustomerSegmentation.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CustomerSegmentation
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   You can use Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab to open the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` file.

4. **Run the notebook**: Follow the steps in the notebook to perform customer segmentation.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and perform data cleaning.
   - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the distribution of key features.
   - Analyze relationships between features using graphs.

3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Implement the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the clusters to interpret the segmentation results.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each segment.

## Results

The notebook presents the results of the clustering analysis, including the identified customer segments and their respective characteristics. Visualizations illustrate how customers are grouped based on their purchasing behavior.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to compare results.
- Incorporate additional features for a more comprehensive segmentation analysis.
- Apply segmentation results to marketing strategies and evaluate their effectiveness.
